## How to get API key

To use this software, you need access to a large language model (LLM) via an API call. Currently, we support [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and [gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/).

The ChatGPT API key is universal for all models; you do not need to create separate keys for each one.

#### Gemini Manual

##### Step 1: Sign into Google AI Studio

To get started, sign in to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) using your Google account. If you don't have an account, you will need to create one first. All Google Workspace users have access to AI Studio by default.

##### Step 2: Navigate to Get API Key

Once you are signed in, go to the dashboard, you will see a "Get API key" button on the topright of the screen. Click this to begin the process of creating your API key.

##### Step 3: Create Your API Key

In the next screen, click on "Create API key". You may be prompted to create the API key in a new or existing project. After making your selection, your unique API key will be generated. Be sure to copy this key and store it in a secure location, as it is essential for using the Gemini API.
