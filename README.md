# Flexible metadata harvesting for ecology using large language models

## ðŸ“¦ Repository Overview

This repository contains a tool that harvests metadata from dataset landing pages.

Our methods are described in more detail in [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-032-06136-2_32), and further data analysis and visualisation functions (used in the paper) are found in [a separate repo](https://github.com/LTER-LIFE/meta-knowledge-harvesting).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- An API key for either [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) or [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/) (see [API Key Setup](#api-key-setup) below)

### Install from GitHub

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/LTER-LIFE/llm-metadata-harvester.git
```

### Install for Development

If you want to modify the code or contribute to the project:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/LTER-LIFE/llm-metadata-harvester.git
cd llm-metadata-harvester
pip install -e .
```

### Additional Setup

After installation, you'll need to install Playwright browsers for web scraping:

```shell
playwright install
```

### API Key Setup

This tool requires an API key for a Large Language Model service. You can use either OpenAI or Google Gemini.

**Quick Setup:**
1. Get your API key following the detailed instructions in [`llm_apikey.md`](llm_apikey.md)
2. Set your API key as an environment variable:

```shell
# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# For Gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in your working directory:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
# or
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Verify Installation

To verify the installation worked correctly:

```python
import llm_metadata_harvester
print("Installation successful!")
```
