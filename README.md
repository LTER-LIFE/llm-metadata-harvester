# Flexible metadata harvesting for ecology using large language models

## ðŸ“¦ Repository Overview

This repository contains a tool that harvests metadata from dataset landing pages.

Our methods are described in more detail in our upcoming paper, and further data analysis and visualisation functions (used in the paper) are found in [a separate repo](https://github.com/LTER-LIFE/meta-knowledge-harvesting).
