    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated metadata extraction from web-based dataset portals.  \n",
    "It showcases an experiment on the [Actual probability distribution for Quercus robur (2000–2020)](https://stac.ecodatacube.eu/veg_quercus.robur_anv.eml/collection.json?.language=en) dataset, using a combination of web scraping and LLM-based entity extraction to populate metadata fields according to the Croissant data standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "- Web scraping utilities for extracting full page text from dataset portals\n",
    "- Environment configuration for flexible API and model usage\n",
    "- LLM client support for OpenAI and Gemini models (with extensibility for custom clients)\n",
    "- Automated extraction of core metadata fields such as description, license, creator, keywords, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the experiment are presented at the end of the notebook.  \n",
    "Some code cells are included for future development and may not be directly relevant to this specific experiment.\n"
